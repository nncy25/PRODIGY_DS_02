Data cleaning and EDA of titanic dataset
# Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to uncover insights about passenger survival using various data analysis and visualization techniques.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing full analysis, visualizations, and insights.
- `train.csv` — Original Titanic dataset (from Kaggle).
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` — Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.

## 📊 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, feature encoding, etc.)
- Explore distributions of variables (age, sex, class, etc.)
- Analyze survival rate by passenger characteristics
- Visualize trends and correlations using plots and heatmaps

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib

## 📌 Key Findings

- Women and children had higher survival rates
- Passengers in 1st class had a higher chance of survival
- Age, Fare, Class, and Sex were significant factors in survival
