Data cleaning and EDA of titanic dataset
# Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to uncover insights about passenger survival using various data analysis and visualization techniques.

## 📁 Files Included

File                             	Description
titanic_EDA.ipynb          	Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning, visualization, and analysis
dataa/titanic.csv         	Dataset file used (if uploaded)
screenshots/	             Folder containing screenshots of visualizations
README.md	                  Project overview and instructions

## 📊 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, feature encoding, etc.)
- Explore distributions of variables (age, sex, class, etc.)
- Analyze survival rate by passenger characteristics
- Visualize trends and correlations using plots and heatmaps

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib

## 📌 Key Findings

- Women and children had higher survival rates
- Passengers in 1st class had a higher chance of survival
- Age, Fare, Class, and Sex were significant factors in survival

## 📎 Source

- Dataset: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
